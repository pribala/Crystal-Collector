# Crystal Collector Game

There are four crystals displayed as buttons on the page. Each crystal has an associated point.

The player is shown a random number at the start of the game.

When the player clicks on a crystal, it will add a specific amount of points which is selected at random by the app to the player's total score.

The player wins if their total score matches the random number from the beginning of the game.

The player loses if their score goes above the random number.

The game restarts whenever the player wins or loses.
